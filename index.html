                    A minimalist canvas for creative exploration.<br />
Calvin Klein is a fashion lifestyle brand with bold, progressive ideals and a sensual aesthetic that is recognized worldwide. Our modern and minimalist approach to design, provocative imagery and authentic connection to culture has resonated across generations for over 50 years. Founded in New York in 1968, the brand elevates everyday essentials to globally iconic status.
                    <br />
                    With 50 years of iconic history, the Calvin Klein brands - CK Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein Jeans, Calvin Klein Underwear and Calvin Klein Performance - have global recognition as iconic household names. Calvin Klein continues to amplify its positioning within society through culturally relevant marketing campaigns, partnerships with key opinion leaders and capsule collections. Each of the Calvin Klein brands has a distinct marketing identity and position, providing us the opportunity to market domestically and internationally a range of products in discrete apparel categories that appeal to the varying needs and lifestyles of the Calvin Klein consumer. The Calvin Klein brands also are licensed for a range of lifestyle products, including fragrance, women's apparel, footwear, eyewear, childrenâ€™s clothing, watches and jewelry, as well as in certain geographic regions. PVH acquired Calvin Klein in 2003 and has overseen a focused approach to growing the brand's presence worldwide, as well as its prestige, recognition and relevance. Global retail sales of products sold under the Calvin Klein brands were approximately $6.2 billion in 2020.
